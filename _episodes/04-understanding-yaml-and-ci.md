# GitLab CI YAML

The GitLab CI configurations are specified using a YAML file called `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Here is an example:

~~~
image: rikorose/gcc-cmake

before_script:
  - mkdir build

build_code:
  script:
    - cd build
    - cmake ../src
    - cmake --build .
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

In the above example, `image: rikorose/gcc-cmake` is a Docker image. This image is an extension of the official gcc image and includes cmake.

> ## `script` commands
>
> Sometimes, `script` commands will need to be wrapped in single or double quotes. For example, commands that contain a colon (`:`) need to be wrapped in quotes so that the YAML parser knows to interpret the whole thing as a string rather than a “key: value” pair. Be careful when using special characters: `:`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`, `&`, `*`, `#`, `?`, `|`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `=`, `!`, `%`, `@`, `\``.
{: .callout}

This is the simplest possible configuration that will work for most code using minimal dependencies with `cmake` and `make`:

1. Define one job `build_code` (the job names are arbitrary) with different commands to be executed.
2. Before every job, the commands defined by `before_script` are executed.

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines sets of jobs with constraints of how and when they should be run. The jobs are defined as top-level elements with a name (in our case `build_code`) and always have to contain the `script` keyword. Let's explore this structure in more depth.

## Overall Structure

Every single parameter we consider for all configurations are keys under jobs. The YAML is structured using job names. For example, we can define three jobs that run in parallel (more on parallel/serial later) with different sets of parameters.

~~~
job1:
  param1: null
  param2: null

job2:
  param1: null
  param3: null

job3:
  param2: null
  param4: null
  param5: null
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

> ## Parallel or Serial Execution?
>
> Note that by default, all jobs you define run in parallel. If you want them to run in serial, or a mix of parallel and serial, or as a directed acyclic graph, we'll cover this in a later section.
{: .callout}

What can you not use as job names? There are a few reserved keywords (because these are used as global parameters for configuration, in addition to being job-specific parameters):

- `default`
- `image`
- `services`
- `stages`
- `types`
- `before_script`
- `after_script`
- `variables`
- `cache`

Global parameters mean that you can set parameters at the top-level of the YAML file. What does that actually mean? Here's another example:

~~~
image: rikorose/gcc-cmake

stages: [build, test, deploy]

job1:
  script: make

job2:
  image: rikorose/gcc-cmake:gcc-6
  script: make
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

where `image` and `stages` are global parameters being used. Note that `job2:image` overrides `:image`.

## Job Parameters

What are some of the parameters that can be used in a job? Rather than copy/pasting from the reference (linked below in this session), we'll go to the [Configuration parameters](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#configuration-parameters) section in the GitLab docs. The most important parameter, and the only one needed to define a job, is `script`

~~~
job one:
  script: make

job two:
  script:
    - python test.py
    - coverage
~~~
{: .language-yaml}

> ## Understanding the Reference
>
> One will notice that the reference uses colons like `:job:image:name` to refer to parameter names. This is represented in yaml like:
> ~~~
> job:
>   image:
>     name: rikorose/gcc-cmake:gcc-6
> ~~~
> {: .language-yaml}
> where the colon refers to a child key.
{: .callout}

## Reference

The reference guide for all GitLab CI/CD pipeline configurations is found at [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/). This contains all the different parameters you can assign to a job.
