You should find your way to your very own GitLab homepage!
For CERN this is [gitlab.cern.ch](https://gitlab.cern.ch).

If you're having issues, **please let us know immediately**
since you won't be able to follow this lesson without access to a GitLab
instance.

## Creating a New Project

Following the [setup for the payload](https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-cms-analysis-webpage/setup.html) to download a tarball of the files needed, you'll want to create new projects (e.g. [at CERNs](https://gitlab.cern.ch/projects/new)) on your personal gitlab account called `virtual-pipelines-eventselection`. Please make sure to set the visibility level to **Public**.

If you have not set this payload up yet, you can clone it from [github](https://github.com/hsf-training/hsf-training-cms-analysis) and push it to your project.

> ## Visibility Level
>
> Make sure you click Public for the visibility level of the new project so that everyone can see your awesome work
> (and it will also make things easier when we get to working with containers).
